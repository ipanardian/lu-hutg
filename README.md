`lu -hut` (**L**isting **U**tility) - is a powerful modern alternative to the Unix ls command that delivers directory listings with beautiful box-drawn tables, stunning tree format, intelligent colors, multiple sorting strategies, advanced filtering, and seamless git integration. Transform your file exploration from mundane to magnificent.

## 💫 Key Features

- **Beautiful Box-Drawn Tables** - Clean, box-drawn tables with colored borders for excellent readability.
- **Hierarchical Directory Priority** - Folders are prioritized at the top of the list for structured navigation.
- **Stunning Tree View Display (-F)** - Display directory structure in a beautiful tree format with all features supported.
- **Dynamic Git Monitoring (-g)** - Real-time tracking of file states (Untracked, Modified, Added) directly in the table.
- **Time-Aware Color Grading (-t)** - Intelligent color schemes based on file age to quickly identify recent changes.
- **Exact Time Display (-T)** - Show precise modification timestamps instead of relative time.
- **Size-Based Sorting (-S)** - Sort files by size with directories prioritized.
- **Extension-Based Sorting (-X)** - Group files by their extensions for better organization.
- **Transparent Object Visibility (-h)** - Explicit monitoring of hidden files (internal metadata) for complete oversight.
- **Unit Coordination Visibility (-u)** - Detailed User and Group identification to maintain accountability.
- **Advanced Filtering Capability** - Strict inclusion and exclusion logic using glob patterns (`-i`, `-x`).
- **Responsive Terminal Scaling** - Adaptive output that maintains data integrity across different terminal widths.
- **Safe Recursive Listing** - Recursive directory traversal with depth limits and cancellation support.

## 🛠️ Operational Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

**macOS and Linux:**

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipanardian/lu-hut/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

### Build from Source

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ipanardian/lu-hut.git
$ cd lu-hut
$ make install
```

Ensure `~/bin` is included in your system `PATH` for seamless execution.

## 📋 Usage Protocol

Execute the `lu` command to begin comprehensive directory monitoring.

```bash
# Standard listing
$ lu

# Git status
$ lu -g

# Sort by modification time (newest first)
$ lu -t

# Sort by size (largest first)
$ lu -S

# Sort by extension
$ lu -X

# Reverse sort order (size)
$ lu -Sr

# Show exact modification time
$ lu -T

# Combine exact time with git status
$ lu -Tg

# Tree view display
$ lu -F

# Tree view with git status
$ lu -Fg

# Tree view with max depth
$ lu -F -L 3

# Tree view with sorting
$ lu -F -S

# List recursive
$ lu -R

# List recursive with max depth
$ lu -R -L 10

# Filtered selection
$ lu -i "*.go" -x "*_test.go"

# Lord mode (Hidden, User, Time Sort)
$ lu -hut

```

## ⚙️ Parameters (Flags)

| Flag   | Long Flag          | Description                                          |
| :----- | :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| **-t** | `--sort-modified`  | Sort by modification time (newest first).            |
| **-S** | `--sort-size`      | Sort by file size (largest first).                   |
| **-X** | `--sort-extension` | Sort by file extension.                              |
| **-r** | `--reverse`        | Reverse sort order.                                  |
| **-g** | `--git`            | Show Git status for each file/directory.             |
| **-h** | `--hidden`         | Include hidden files in the listing.                 |
| **-u** | `--user`           | Show User and Group ownership metadata.              |
| **-T** | `--exact-time`     | Show exact modification time instead of relative.    |
| **-F** | `--tree`           | Display directory structure in a tree format.        |
| **-R** | `--recursive`      | List subdirectories recursively.                     |
| **-L** | `--max-depth`      | Maximum recursion depth (0 = no limit, default: 30). |
| **-i** | `--include`        | Include files matching specified glob patterns.      |
| **-x** | `--exclude`        | Exclude files matching specified glob patterns.      |

### 🔄 Sorting Priority

When multiple sorting flags are specified, the priority order is:

1. **Size** (`-S`) - Highest priority
2. **Extension** (`-X`)
3. **Modified Time** (`-t`)
4. **Name** (default) - Lowest priority

Only one sorting mode is active at a time.

### 💡 Pro Tips Like a "Lord"

- Use `-T` for precise timestamps when auditing file changes
- Combine `-S` with `-r` to find smallest files first
- Use `-X` to group files by type for better organization
- Tree view supports all flags including git status, sorting, and filtering
- Recursive listing respects all filters and sorting options
- Press `Ctrl+C` during recursive listing to cancel safely
